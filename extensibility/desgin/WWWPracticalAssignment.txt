WWW: Web 2.0 File-based Tools and Services

Introduction

Web applications have are generally designed and implemented using tierd architectures, using a database-centric approach for the design of the data tier. However, the use of a database-centric design is arguably not always necessary. Incidentally, the digital libraries laboratory has been conducting research focused on simplifying the design of repository software architectures, and a number of experimental tools and services have been designed and implemented using the simplyCT framework --a framework for simple online or offline digital archives with preservation, standardisation and extensibility being major focii.

Some experimental simplyCT-based tools and services that have been implementated are as follows:

Task

Develop a simplyCT-based, tierd Web application/service that makes use of a file-based store as the storage tier.

Your task is to use one of the data sources below to create a new service. Examples of services include: data visualisation services, full-text search services, Web service APIs (using REST, RSS), etc.

Your submission will be marked at a demo scheduled soon after the due date, according to the following criteria:

 -> Service operates correctly (x%)
 -> Logical organisation, design& implementation of file store (x%)
    -> Metadata
    -> Relationships between items
 -> Portability of service (x%)
 -> Usefulness of service (x%)
 -> Originality (x%)
 -> Short report describing service (x%)
 -> Demonstration and interview session for individual groups (x%)
