      -> Define a list to hold 5 recently added items
      -> Start adding items to list ensuring that item to be added is not already in defined list (idea here is to add unique items to list)
    -> 
    -> For each of the 5 items in list
      -> Use PyRSS2Gen module to write essential metadata associated to item
